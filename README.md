# Send To Kindle

###  Email links to your Kindle.

Amazon Kindle owners can already [mail attachments](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email) to their Kindle. But sometimes you're on your phone and you just want to send yourself a _link_--and have something fetch that link and send it to your Kindle nicely formatted.

## How To Configure

1. Follow the directions [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX9XLEVV8G4DB28H) to add `kindle@x.af0.net` as an approved email sender to your Kindle. 

1. Get your Kindle's unique email address by going to [Manage Your Content and Devices](https://www.amazon.com/mn/dcw/myx.html/ref=kinw_myk_surl_1#/home/devices/). (Click your device, and see the "Email" field.)

1. Take the part before the `@kindle.com`. For example, if your Kindle email is `bob_1234@kindle.com`, take the `bob_1234`.

1. When you want to share something with your Kindle, just send yourself an email at `kindle+[the part above]@x.af0.net`. For the above example, it would be `kindle+bob_1234@x.af0.net`. 

You can send yourself links or PDF attachments. Enjoy!
